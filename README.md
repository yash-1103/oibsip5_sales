Sales Prediction
In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey of data exploration, model development, and evaluation. Our initial data exploration revealed key insights into the dataset's characteristics, showcasing the relationships between advertising expenditures in TV, Radio, Newspaper channels, and sales. The subsequent process of training three distinct models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, provided valuable perspectives on their performance. However, the Random Forest model emerged as the most compelling solution, offering a balance of interpretability and robust predictive power. With a considerably lower MSE and effective feature importance analysis, it illuminated the dominant influence of the TV advertising channel on sales. This conclusion underscores the potential of Random Forest as a dependable tool for sales prediction and data-driven marketing decisions.
